# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

This project is the final capstone for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

---

## Project Objective

To apply key data analysis skills—including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization—on a real-world dataset to solve a business-related problem or generate actionable insights.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:**  
  Collected data using web scraping techniques and/or APIs.

- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:**  
  Addressed missing values, normalized formats, and corrected inconsistencies.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Uncovered trends, outliers, and distributions to form hypotheses.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Built informative visualizations to support conclusions and highlight key findings.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `Pandas` – for data manipulation  
  - `NumPy` – for numerical operations  
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` – for data visualization  
  - `Requests/BeautifulSoup` or `API packages` – for data scraping
